# Personal blog website template
This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting &amp; style.

## Starter Code?
In this project, you'll get to start from scratch! To complete the project, you are able to decide on the HTML and CSS files to include as part of your work, given that the end result is within the confines of the project rubric provided below. This should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:

- The blog website

While it can be a bit intimidating to start from scratch for your first time, we have also provided some helpful hints on a later page to help you determine your Development Strategy for the project. If you are ready to get started though, we encourage you to skip the next section and figure it out on your own!
